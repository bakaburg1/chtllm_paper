\title{Sequence Generation from Vector Range}
\usage{
seq_range(x, by = NULL, length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector from which to extract the range.}

\item{by}{Number: increment of the sequence. If NULL, defaults to 1 for
integer sequences.}

\item{length.out}{Desired length of the sequence. A non-negative number,
which for seq() will be rounded up if fractional.}

\item{along.with}{Take the length from the length of this argument.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to seq().}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the sequence from min(x) to max(x).
}
\description{
Extends seq() to automatically compute from and to from the vector range
values. This function takes a vector, finds its range (min and max), and
generates a sequence between those values.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage with by parameter
seq_range(c(1, 10), by = 1)

# Using length.out instead of by
seq_range(c(0, 100), length.out = 11)

# Works with unordered input
seq_range(c(10, 1, 5, 3), by = 2)
}
