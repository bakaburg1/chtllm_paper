\title{Extract posterior draws from fitted Bayesian models}
\usage{
extract_posterior_draws(model, ndraws = NULL, resp = NULL, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Fitted brms model object.}

\item{ndraws}{Number of draws to extract (NULL for all draws).}

\item{resp}{Response variable name for multivariate models (NULL for
univariate).}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducible subsampling when ndraws is not NULL.
If NULL, results may vary between runs.}
}
\value{
A tibble with posterior draws, always using \code{.prob} as the value
column for consistency across model types.
}
\description{
Extracts posterior draws from fitted brms models using tidybayes, with
support for subsampling and reproducible results.
}
\details{
This function provides a consistent interface for extracting posterior
predictive draws across different brms model types (binomial, multinomial,
ordinal). When ndraws is specified and is less than the total number of
posterior draws, the function will randomly subsample. Use the seed parameter
to ensure reproducible subsampling.
