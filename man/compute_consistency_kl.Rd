\title{Compute KL Divergence consistency score from posterior draws}
\usage{
compute_consistency_kl(draws)
}
\arguments{
\item{draws}{Posterior draws from multinomial consistency model with .prob
and .category columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble with scaled KL divergence values in .prob column. Higher
values indicate higher consistency.
}
\description{
Transforms posterior probability draws into a scaled KL divergence value,
measuring deviation from a uniform distribution. A score of 1 represents
perfect consistency (a deterministic response), while a score of 0 represents
perfect inconsistency (a uniform distribution of responses).
