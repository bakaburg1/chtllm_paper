\title{Compute Modal consistency score from posterior draws}
\usage{
compute_consistency_modal(draws)
}
\arguments{
\item{draws}{Posterior draws from multinomial consistency model with .prob
and .category columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble with modal probability values in .prob column. Higher values
indicate higher consistency.
}
\description{
Calculates the modal probability from posterior draws. The score is the
probability of the most likely response category. A score of 1 represents
perfect consistency (a deterministic response).
