Must contain \code{model_id} and a \code{.prob} column.}

\item{x_lab}{Label for the x-axis.}

\item{y_lab}{Label for the y-axis.}

\item{title}{The plot title.}

\value{
A ggplot object.

\description{
Creates a scatter plot that categorizes models into four quadrants based on
their performance on two different metrics (e.g., correctness vs.
consistency). Models in extreme quartiles are labeled, while those in inner
quartiles are more transparent.
