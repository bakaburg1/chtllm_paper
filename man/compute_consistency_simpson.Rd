\title{Compute Simpson consistency score from posterior draws}
\usage{
compute_consistency_simpson(draws)
}
\arguments{
\item{draws}{Posterior draws from multinomial consistency model with .prob
and .category columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble with Simpson index values in .prob column. Higher values
indicate higher consistency.
}
\description{
Calculates the Simpson concentration index from posterior probability draws.
The index represents the probability that two randomly selected responses
would be the same. A score of 1 represents perfect consistency (a
deterministic response).
